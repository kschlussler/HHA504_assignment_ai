## Exploring AI and Analytics with Pre-trained Models in Azure and GCP
# 1. GCP Speech-to-Text API
Steps Taken:
Enabled the Speech-to-Text API in the Google Cloud Console.
Set up a Vertex AI Notebook environment.
Uploaded the audio file and used the Speech-to-Text API to transcribe it.

I encountered an issue where I couldnâ€™t hear the audio properly. To address this, I ensured the audio file was in the correct format (WAV). I documented the issue and moved forward.

# 2. GCP Vision API
Steps Taken:
Enabled the Vision API in the Google Cloud Console.
Used a Vertex AI Notebook to upload and analyze an image.
Applied the Vision API to detect objects and text within the image.


# 3. Azure AI Vision
Steps Taken:
Set up an Azure Machine Learning (AML) Notebook.
Configured the Vision API and uploaded the same image used in GCP.
Ran the Vision API to detect and describe objects/text in the image.


Issues Faced:
Difficulty in setting up API permissions and handling large audio/image files.
Could not hear the audio properly during processing, which limited verification of audio quality and transcription accuracy.

Solutions:
Double-checked and updated API permissions.
Documented the audio issue and focused on analyzing the output provided by the Speech-to-Text API.
